      <p class="paragraph">Hey people, welcome to my portfolio, I am a 19 year old undergraduate with a passion for software development. I excell in HTML, CSS, JS, Java<br>
      -and Python. I am currently pursing my Computer Science degree at Informatics Institute of Technology affiliated with University of Westminster.<br>
      My drive for technology had started at a very young age when I was first introduced to computers in 2009, when I was around 5. I was very fond<br>
      -of technology, I was later into the physical components of the computer, I still remember how I used to spend hours trying to learn where each<br>
      -of the components would go. I was also into open world, FPS </p>
